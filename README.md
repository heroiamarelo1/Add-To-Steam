# Add to Steam
This tool allows you to easly add your non-steam games to Steam automaticly, just by righ-clicking on shortcut on .exe file


1) Run add_to_steam_context.exe
It will create a .reg file on the same folder (this file will create the context menu)
2) Run the created .reg file

And it's working!

If you have multiple Steam accounts you will need to select one from the list.
To discord your account ID visit https://steamid.io/

After installing a shortcut you can press it again to remove the shortcut instead.

I made this with the help of ChatGPT and Gemini.
This program is open source.
Do whatever you want with it. lol
